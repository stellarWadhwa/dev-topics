GraphQL simplifies API building because you don't have to create custom endpoints for every single scenario. You just define the schema and thats it, you can query what ever you want.  Imagine you're building a house, and you need to order materials from different suppliers. With REST, you'd have to order each material separately, and each supplier would give you a fixed set of materials, regardless of whether you need them all or not. With GraphQL, you can specify exactly which materials you need, and each supplier will only give you what you asked for, reducing waste and improving efficiency.
