Agile dev

agile dev follows the agile lifecycle of development.

Basically it is the methdology where development is done in phases, but each phase provides a running, tested project. It may lack features but it is available. Further updates, correction, deletion, addition can be done later but for now a part of the project is avilable to run.

Unlike waterfall method, waterfall method focuses on building up the whole project at once, which may lead to updates and deletion at the final delivery.
